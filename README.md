# HM_Recommender_System

2-stage recommender system

## Retrieval Part

Before we score the items we need to select a reasonably relevant set that contains the items that the user will eventually engage with. This stage will select thousands or hundreds of candidates from all millions or even tens of millions of items to simplify the problem.

## Ranking Part

The role of the ranking model is to rank the candidates generated by the retrieval model and select the most likely product as the final prediction. Compared with the retrieval model, the ranking model can make more detailed comparisons, because the data involved is much less than the retrieval model, resulting in more accurate prediction results.
