## Collaborative filtering

Collaborative Filtering is a technique or a method to predict a userâ€™s taste and find the items that a user might prefer on the basis of information collected from various other users having similar tastes or preferences. It takes into consideration the basic fact that if person X and person Y have a certain reaction for some items then they might have the same opinion for other items too.
